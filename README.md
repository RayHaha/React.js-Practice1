This is my first code while learning React.js on Udemy.

I'll just record the first "Hello world" code in helloworld.js then keep going to build the project.

Finally, the program became some approval card with some component.
We used the "props" to communicate between parents and children components.
We also used the faker library to generate some fake avatars and semantic.min.css library to get CSS style instead of hard coding by myself.
